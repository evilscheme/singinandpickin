```chordpro
{Verse 1}
[Am]Oh the cuckoo, [G]she's a pretty bird
She [Am]warbles as she [E7]flies
She [Am]never says [G]cuckoo
Till the [E7]fourth day of [Am]July

{Verse 2}
[Am]Jack of diamonds, [G]jack of diamonds
I've [Am]known you from of [E7]old
You've [Am]robbed my poor [G]pockets
Of [E7]silver and of [Am]gold
```
