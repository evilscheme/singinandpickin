{Intro}
[Am]----|----|[G]----|[Am]----

[Am]----|----|[G]----|[Am]----

{Verse 1}

[Am]Gonna build me a log cabin on a [G]mountain so[Am] high
So I can see my darling as [G]she goes passing[Am] by

{Chorus}
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird and she [G]warbles[E] as[Am] she flies
But she never says cuckoo 'till the [G]fourth day[E] of[Am] July

{Interlude}

[Am]----|----|[G]----|[Am]----

{Verse 2}
Now my horses, they ain't hungry and they [G]won't eat your[Am] hay
So I'll ride on just a little further and [G]feed them[Am] on the way

{Chorus}
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird and she [G]warbles[E] as[Am] she flies
She will cause you never no trouble and she'll [G]tell you[E] no[Am] lie

{Solo}

[Am]----|----|[G]----|[Am]----

[Am]----|----|[G]----|[Am]----

{Verse 3}
You can see that I have wandered by the [G]dust that's [Am]on my feet
Now I'll build me a log cabin, let my [G]true love look[Am] for me

{Chorus}
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird and she [G]warbles[E] as[Am] she flies
But she never says cuckoo 'till the [G]fourth day[E] of[Am] July

{Outro}

[Am]----|----|[G]----|----

[Am]----|----|[G]----|-[A]---
