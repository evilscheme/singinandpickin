{Intro}
[D]-----[G]-----[D]-----[A]-----[D]

{Verse 1}
[D]Hush little darlin' don’t say a [G]word
Papa's gonna buy you a mocking [D]bird
[A]Say, darlin’, [D]say
[D]If that mocking bird won't [G]sing
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond [D]ring
[A]Say, darlin’, [D]say

{Interlude}

{Verse 2}
If that diamond ring turns brass
Papa’s gonna buy you a looking glass
Say, darlin’, say
If that looking glass gets broke
Papa’s gonna buy you a billy goat
Say, darlin’, say
  
{Interlude}
 
{Verse 3}
If that billy goat won’t pull
Papa’s gonna buy you a cart and bull
Say, darlin’, say
If that cart and bull falls over
Papa’s gonna buy you a dog named Rover
Say, darlin’, say 
 
{Interlude}
 
{Verse 4}
If that dog named Rover don’t bark
Papa’s gonna buy you a horse and cart
Say, darlin’, say
If that horse and cart falls down
You're still the prettiest baby in town
Say, darlin’, say
 
{Interlude}
 
{Verse 5}
Say pretty darlin' you'll be mine
Wouldn’t do nothing but starch and iron
Say, darlin’, say
Starch and iron would be your trade
I’d get drunk and lay in the shade
Say, darlin’, say
 
{Verse 6}
Hey pretty darlin' will you marry me
We'll be married by the old oak tree
Say, darlin', say
We'll get married by the old oak tree
Two little babies just sittin' on my knee
Say, darlin', say

{Outro}
