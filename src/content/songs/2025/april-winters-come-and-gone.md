{Intro}
G repeat for a bit

{Verse 1}
[G]oh little red bird come to my window sill
[G]been so lonesome shaking that morning c[Em]hill
[G]Oh little red bird open your mouth and say
[G]been so lonesome just about flown away

{Chorus}
[C] so long now i've been out in the rain and s[G]now
but wi[Em]nter's come and gone and a
[C]little bird told me s[G]o

{Verse 2}
[G]oh little blue bird pearly feather breast
[G]five cold nickels all that i got [Em]left
[G]oh little blue bird what am i gonna do
[G]five cold nickels ain't gonna see me through

{Chorus}
[C] so long now i've been out in the rain and s[G]now
but wi[Em]nter's come and gone and a
[C]little bird told me s[G]o

{Verse 3}
[G]oh little black bird on my wire line
[G]dark as trouble in this heart of m[Em]ine
[G]oh little black bird sings a worried song
[G]dark as trouble til winters come and gone

{Chorus}
[C] so long now i've been out in the rain and s[G]now
but wi[Em]nter's come and gone and a
[C]little bird told me s[G]o
