{Intro}
[A] [A] [Dsus2] [A]

{Verse 1}
[A]There's a l[A]ight on i[A]n your house[Dsus2]
But you're not home today[A]  [A]  [Dsus2]      [A]
And e[A]ach time I c[A]ome on by[Dsus2] you seem so far awa[A]y [Dsus2]      [A]
Can you[G] give me some[D] reason to hold [A]on[A]  [Dsus2]      [A]
Can you[G] give me som[D]e reason to stay

{Instrumental}
[A] [A] [Dsus2] [A]

{Verse 2}
Got some [A]friends knock[A]ing on my door[Dsus2]
Wondering where I've been[A]  [A]  [Dsus2]      [A]
Tired of [A]mining [A]for your heart[Dsus2], I've come up for air again[A]  [Dsus2]      [A]
Can you[G] give me some[D] reason to hold [A]on[A]  [Dsus2]      [A]
Can you[G] give me som[D]e reason to stay[A]

{Chorus}
Stay[E]
Now I'm go[A]ing away[D], will I [A]leave you crying[E]
It's been [A]40 days [D]but this [A]love is dying   [E]
I've searched [A]all aroun[D]d for s[A]omething[G]
[D]Something to [A]hold onto, [G]and a r[D]eason to stay

{Interlude}
[A] [A] [Dsus2] [A]

[A] [A] [Dsus2] [A]

{Verse 3}
So I'm [A]cashing in your [A]promises [Dsus2]
Gonna leave without a [A]sound[A]  [Dsus2]      [A]
Got a [A]broken heart and[A] aching head [Dsus2]
Cause I know you can't be [A]found  [Dsus2]      [A]
Can you[G] give me some[D] reason to hold [A]on[A]  [Dsus2]      [A]
Can you[G] give me som[D]e reason to s[A]tay

{Chorus}
Stay[E]
Now I'm go[A]ing away[D], will I [A]leave you crying[E]
It's been [A]40 days [D]but this [A]love is dying   [E]
I've searched [A]all aroun[D]d for s[A]omething[G]
[D]Something to [A]hold onto, [G]and a r[D]eason to [A]stay
Stay[E]
Now I'm go[A]ing away[D], will I [A]leave you crying[E]
It's been [A]40 days [D]but this [A]love is dying   [E]
I've searched [A]all aroun[D]d for s[A]omething[G]
[D]Something to [A]hold onto, [G]and a r[D]eason to [A]stay [Dsus2]       [G]
[D]Something to [A]hold onto, [G]and a r[D]eason to [A]stay
