{Intro}
[A]

{Verse 1}
Ain't that your jacket in the mu[D]droom
Ai[E]n't those your shoes there b[A]y the door
Y[F#m]ou never left the house with[D]out them
[E]Now you don't need them any[A]more

{Verse 2}
Ain't those your keys there on the ta[D]ble
T[E]hey've gone everywhere you g[A]o
T[F#m]hey opened every door you walked thro[D]ugh
T[E]urned every engine on your ro[A]ad

{Bridge}

[C#7]I'd run those keys out to the drivew[D]ay
J[E]oke that "you wouldn't have gone fa[A]r"
[C#7]And now you're further than you've e[D]ver been from [E]me
T[D]han you've ever been from [E]me

{Chorus}
Like a so[A]ng I can't see you
But you mo[E]ve me just the same
Like the ra[D]dio waves all through the air
You inv[A]isibly make it ok[E]ay

Like the m[A]oon I can't touch you
But you pu[E]ll me just the same
Like the cr[D]ashing of waves

All through the ocean
I ris[A]e and I fall in your na[E]me
All in your nam[A]e

{Verse 3}
They say at first the pain is pie[D]rcing
A[E]n angry bee inside your che[A]st
B[F#m]ut it can't sting like that fore[D]ver
[E]Even heartbreak takes a res[A]t

{Bridge 2}
[C#7]They say just like a sword in batt[D]le
A[E] sharpened blade will slowly du[A]ll
W[C#7]ith every thought inside my min[D]d that you po[E]ssess
It'll hu[D]rt a little le[E]ss

{Chorus}
Like a so[A]ng I can't see you
But you mo[E]ve me just the same
Like the ra[D]dio waves all through the air
You inv[A]isibly make it ok[E]ay

Like the m[A]oon I can't touch you
But you pu[E]ll me just the same
Like the cr[D]ashing of waves

All through the ocean
I ris[A]e and I fall in your na[E]me
All in your nam[A]e     [Bm]

[F#m]All in your na[E]me   (a[Bm]h)
[F#m]All in your na[E]me   (a[Bm]h)
[F#m]All in your na[E]me   (a[Bm]h)
[F#m]All in your na[E]me

Like a so[A]ng I can't see you
N.C.
But you move me just the same
N.C.
Like the radio waves all through the air
N.C.
You invisibly make it okay

Like the m[A]oon I can't touch you
But you pu[E]ll me just the same
Like the cr[D]ashing of waves

All through the ocean
I ris[A]e and I fall in your na[E]me

All in your na[Bm]me
[F#m]All in your nam[E]e
All in your na[Bm]me
[F#m]All in your nam[E]e

All in your na[Bm]me
[F#m]All in your nam[E]e

All in your na[Bm]me
All in your nam[E]e
