{Intro}
[Bb] [Am] [G#] [Gm] [Dsus]

{Verse 1}
I'm not gon[Cadd9]na lie[C/B] to y[Am7]ou, somethings mi[G]ssing,
We don't have t[Cadd9]o make [C/B]belie[Am7]ve, nothings g[G]one,
[Cadd9]We've, [C/B]had the [Am7]time to see where we're g[G]oing,[Em7]
But we're still a[Cadd9] long, [C/B]way, [Am7]off from knowin w[D]hy,

{Chorus}
I can't re[Cadd9]member, the last time[Em7],
You l[Am7]ooked me in the e[D]ye,
I can't r[Cadd9]emember a [Em7]way to make you [Am7]cry,  [C]

{Verse 2}
I know it's been a[Cadd9] long, [C/B]long [Am7]time since I li[G]stened,
And it's been a[Cadd9] long, [C/B]long [Am7]time since we've been cl[G]ear,
[Cadd9]Many co[C/B]uld [Am7]live on what we have wa[G]sted,[Em7]
All because we[Cadd9] never [C/B]knew [Am7]how much we h[D]ad,

{Chorus}
I can't re[Cadd9]member, the last time[Em7],
You l[Am7]ooked me in the e[D]ye,
I can't r[Cadd9]emember a [Em7]way to make you [Am7]cry,  [C]
I know it's been a[Cadd9] long, [C/B]long [Am7]time,
It's been a [Cadd9]long, l[C/B]ong t[Am7]ime,
[Cadd9]Man   [C/B] y could l[Am7]ive on what we have was[D]ted,
I can't re[Cadd9]member, the last time[Em7],
You l[Am7]ooked me in the e[D]ye,
I can't r[Cadd9]emember a [Em7]way to make you [Am7]cry,  [C]
And it's been a[Cadd9] long, [C/B]long [Am7]time,
It's been a [Cadd9]long, l[C/B]ong t[Am7]ime,
[Cadd9]long, l[C/B]ong t[Am7]ime,
